you will need 2x files/folders for this to work: -Custom Folder this folder sits at the top of the DayZoffline.Enoch map when u open it, when u open the "Custom Folder" scroll down and click Upload and choose this file to upload. _cfgGamePlay.json this file is located is the "DayZoffline.Enoch" Folder, when you open the folder, scroll down untill you find the "cfgGamePlay.json" when you open this fill scroll down untill you find "objectSpawnersArr": ["", here you will need to Copy/Paste the .JSON file Name "LipinaManCave.json" but you will have to add the following to the code to make it work "custom/LipinaManCave.json" so the code will look as followed

"objectSpawnersArr": ["custom/LipinaManCave.json"],

and yes you can add more custom file here is an example

"objectSpawnersArr": ["custom/AdminBase.json","custom/AdminRoger.json","custom/AdminWill.json","custom/ArmiCastle1.json","custom/LipinaManCave.json","custom/ArmiTHtst.json","custom/ArmiTT.json","custom/ArmiXplsv.json","custom/Bill.json","custom/BridgeTst2.json","custom/DustyStuart.json","custom/Eddy.json","custom/GlnskChllns.json","custom/GlnskFUEL.json","custom/GltchNtsK.json","custom/PVPcenter.json","custom/PVPgate.json","custom/PVPtower.json","custom/PVPtracks.json","custom/PVPwall.json","custom/ShipStorage.json","custom/Trckr.json"],

as you can see, its possible to have more then one custom file
